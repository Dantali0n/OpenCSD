\section{Design for Manufacter}

% The current prototype is only suitable for simulation. Several changes are
% necessary for real world applications. Firstly, addition to the NVMe command set
% in the form of a new NVMe namespace. Secondly, the ABI needs to be formalized
% and become a integral part of the specification. Third, existing drivers, such
% as SPDK or xNVME, must be updated to support this new namespace and commands.

% Describe how the design would change for a real world, practical
% implementation. Take the ICD loader diagram as base.

% Use statfs to determine the type of filesystem, ICDs are related to a specific
% filesystem type. The CSx eBPF ABI should contain atleast one system call to
% retrieve the vendor filesystem context data for the current request (already
% part of prototype). The CSx FS API contains functions and datastructures to
% allow the kernel to transform this context data. The API is implemented by
% individual filesystems as shared library and made available throught the ICD.
% The CSx FS runtime uses a loader with mechanisms such as \textit{dlopen} to
% verify the contents of the provided library in accordance to the API.

% The basic format of the ICD can be extended such that it could support
% extensions to the base API as well as contain versioning. Typically, ICD files
% are human readable using a markup language such as YAML. This is same approach
% as the prominent video graphics API Vulkan.
